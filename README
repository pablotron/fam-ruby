Introduction
============
FAM-Ruby is a Ruby interface to SGI's File Alteration Monitor
(http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/).  FAM allows you to monitor files and
directories for changes (file modification, creation, and removal) -- in
an event-driven manner.  FAM is available on a variety of platforms,
including Irix, Linux, and BSD variants (a patch for systems that use
dnotify is also available).  An RDoc-generated API reference is
available in doc/, and a brief description of each event code is
available in event_codes.txt.
