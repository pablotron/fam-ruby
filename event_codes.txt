FAM-Ruby Event Codes
====================

- Fam::Event::CHANGED
  Sent when a monitored file (or a file in a monitored directory)
  changes.

- Fam::Event::DELETED
  Sent when a monitored file (or a file in a monitored directory) is
  deleted.

- Fam::Event::START_EXECUTING
  Sent when a monitored file (or a file in a monitored directory) is
  executed.  Note: this event is not available on certain platforms (ex.
  FAM under Linux without the Imon patch).

- Fam::Event::STOP_EXECUTING
  Sent when a monitored file (or a file in a monitored directory) is
  finished executing. Note: this event is not available on certain
  platforms (ex.  FAM under Linux without the Imon patch).

- Fam::Event::CREATED
  Sent when a monitored file (or a file in a monitored directory) is
  created.

- Fam::Event::MOVED
  Sent when a monitored file (or a file in a monitored directory) is
  renamed or moved.  Note: as far as I can tell, this does not appear to
  work in Linux (FAM reports DELETED and CREATED events instead), so
  you're probably better off not using it.

- Fam::Event::ACKNOWLEDGE
  Sent when FAM acknowledges certain commands (Fam::Connection#cancel,
  for example).

- Fam::Event::ACK
  Synonym for Fam::Event::ACKNOWLEDGE.

- Fam::Event::EXISTS
  Sent after the initial monitor_* method is called if the monitored
  file exists.  For monitored directories, this event will be sent once
  for each file in the directory.

- Fam::Event::END_EXIST
  Sent when the end of the exists list is reached.
